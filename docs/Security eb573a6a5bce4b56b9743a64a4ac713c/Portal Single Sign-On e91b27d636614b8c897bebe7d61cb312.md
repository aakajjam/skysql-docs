# Portal Single Sign-On

By default, authentication to the SkySQL Portal is performed with MariaDB ID credentials.

For Power Tier customers, the SkySQL Portal can be configured to accept authentication with your SAML 2.0 IDP (identity provider). Google G Suite, Auth0, and Azure AD have been tested.

## **Alternatives**

Users with personal or business Google G Suite accounts can authenticate via social login. This ability does not depend on enterprise authentication configuration.

## **Enable**

Contact [SkySQL Support](https://mariadb.com/docs/skysql-dbaas/working/nr-contact-support/) for more information on enabling enterprise authentication.
