# Support
SkySQL is operated by a team of site reliability engineers (SREs), support engineers and MariaDB-certified database administrators (SkyDBAs).

## What Support is Available?
Foundation Tier services include Standard Support (full technical support during business hours).

[Power Tier](<Billing and Power Tier>) customers choose between Enterprise and Platinum support plans optimized to meet the needs of mission-critical deployments requiring 24x7 support and higher SLAs.

The Enterprise and Platinum Support Plans are priced as a percentage of SkySQL usage and are available to Power Tier customers. [SkyDBA](FractionalDBA.md) is an additional option available to customers with Enterprise or Platinum Support Plans.
